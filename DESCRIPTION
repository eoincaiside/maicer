Description: Application of inverse propensity score weighting as defined in 
    NICE Technical Support Document 18, Appendix D, in order to perform a 
    Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison. The implementation makes use of
    individual patient data (IPD) from one clinical trial and summary aggregate
    data of another trial in order to match the patient baseline characteristics
    of the IPD trial to those of the aggregate data trial.
